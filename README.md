# Data-Science-Lab

These Labs are a collection of tutorials and experiments for understanding the concepts of Data Science. These were performed under the guidance of Dr. Preeti Jani.

Each lab contains a focused combination of rich comments and code demonstrating how to solve a specific problem with machine learning and data science.

Labs are self-contained, so all of the instructions and resources needed to run executable code can be found in the lab directory.
